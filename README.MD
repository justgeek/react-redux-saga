# React Redux Saga Starter Kit

This is a boilerplate based on #react #redux #saga. I have been searching for
such a thing, but in vain, so I decided to make it myself. Please feel free to
contribute in code base improvements of this repository, or even by just
submitting suggestions.

RRS uses some helpers to facilitate the development process, but all components
can be totally ommited or altered

This repository is based on Typescript.

This repository is created from scratch without using create-reacct-app
